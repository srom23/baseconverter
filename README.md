# Converter

This project is a simple web application that allows users to interact with an Ethereum/BASE smart contract using MetaMask. The contract provides three functions:
1. `store(uint256 num)` - Stores a uint value on the blockchain.
2. `storedUintToHex()` - Retrieves the stored uint value as a hexadecimal string.
3. `stringToHex(string _i)` - Converts a given string to its hexadecimal representation.

## Getting Started

To use this application, you'll need to have the MetaMask browser extension installed. Make sure you're connected to an Ethereum wallet through MetaMask.
